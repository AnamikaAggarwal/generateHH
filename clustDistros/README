--- Macros to get variable distributions from cluster analysis ---

prerequisite: CMSSW_7_4_4 environemnt (cmsenv CMSSW_7_4_4; cd CMSSW_7_4_4/src; scram b; cmsenv)

Commands sequence:
- create ascii file names list and put it in 'utils'
- create root file with variables distributions using 'makeDistros5D.C'
(check before hard coded input parameters)
- copy cluster results in 'results'
- check name conversion map in 'utils'
- run nameconversion.py to create cluster results file with sample names in.

now you can create plots with distributions using: 
- plot_5D.C --> one canvas per cluster per variable.
- plot_unique5D.C --> all clusters in one canvas. One canvas per Nclus.
- plot_samstory5D.C --> plot the cluster with a selected sample for all the different Nclus.
- plot_samstory5DforPaper.C --> .....
