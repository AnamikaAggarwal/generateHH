--- Macros to get variable distributions from cluster analysis ---

prerequisite: 
- CMSSW_7_4_4 environemnt (cmsenv CMSSW_7_4_4; cd CMSSW_7_4_4/src; scram b; cmsenv)
- a folder with ascii files -> better to use original folder in Xanda area
- a folder for future plots -> better to place it in '../../' from the working area.

Commands sequence:
- use list_ascii file in 'utils'
- create root file with variables distributions using 'makeDistros5D.C' (needed only once!)
- copy cluster results in 'results' 

now you can create plots with distributions using: 
- plot_5D.C --> one canvas per cluster per variable.
- plot_unique5D.C --> all clusters in one canvas. One canvas per Nclus.
- plot_samstory5D.C --> plot the cluster with a selected sample for all the different Nclus
